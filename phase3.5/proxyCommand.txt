Job notification form...

//Ignore
Those companies which register thru portal will fill their JNF by loggin in to their account. While i need a public link also with same kind of interface for JNF only, such that anybody with that link can reach the form(completely empty) n fill all the details. den if even someone doesnt register on portal i can provide the link to him n he can fill the details there.
Public entries will be sorted on email basis. n in that case ask for password n regiter him automatically once he submits jnf.
